## Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in Handling Large Inventories

- Efficient Data Retrieval: With a large number of products, quickly finding a specific product or a subset of products (e.g., those below a certain quantity) is essential.

- Memory Management: Proper data structures ensure optimal use of memory, preventing wastage and allowing the system to handle larger datasets.

- Speed: Efficient algorithms and data structures reduce the time complexity of operations like searching, adding, updating, and deleting products.

## Suitable Data Structures

- ArrayList: Good for scenarios where the primary operation is iterating over the entire list. Adding and retrieving elements by index are efficient.

- HashMap: Ideal for key-value pairs, allowing for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions. This is suitable for inventory management where each product can be identified by a unique productId.

For this problem, HashMap is the most suitable due to its average O(1) time complexity for add, update, and delete operations.

## Time Complexity: O(1)

## Optimization:
We can implement Lazy Loading which will load product details on demand rather than all at once, reducing initial load time and memory usage.
