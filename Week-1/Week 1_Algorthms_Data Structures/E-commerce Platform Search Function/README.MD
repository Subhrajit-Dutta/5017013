## Big O notation:

Big O notation describes the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm in the worst-case scenario. It provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm's efficiency as the input size grows. It helps in comparing the efficiency of different algorithms by focusing on the most significant terms and ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms.

## Best, Average, and Worst-case Scenarios for Search Operations

- Best-case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of steps. For a search, this is typically when the target element is the first element in the data structure.

- Average-case: The scenario that represents the expected time complexity under typical conditions. This involves averaging the time complexity over all possible inputs.

- Worst-case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of steps. For a search, this is typically when the target element is not present or is the last element.

## Time Complexity Comparison:

Linear Search:
Best-case: O(1) – The target element is the first element.

Average-case: O(n) – The target element is somewhere in the middle.

Worst-case: O(n) – The target element is the last element or not present at all.

Binary Search:
Best-case: O(1) – The target element is the middle element.

Average-case: O(logn) – The search space is halved with each step.

Worst-case: O(logn) – The target element is at one of the extremes or not present at all.

## For an e-commerce platform with potentially large datasets, binary search is more suitable due to its logarithmic time complexity.
