Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. A recursive function calls itself with modified arguments to solve these smaller instances.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of periods. This is because each recursive call reduces the number of periods by 1, leading to a linear number of calls.

Optimization: Memoization
Problem with Basic Recursion: The basic recursive approach can lead to excessive recomputation of values if the same period is calculated multiple times.

Solution: Memoization is a technique to store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again, avoiding redundant calculations and improving performance.
